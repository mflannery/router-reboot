# Rebooting my AT&T Residential Gateway router

My AT&T Residential Gateway (Fiber to the home router which I will call RG from this point on) runs into some kind of issue occasionally and when I contact support I am told to reboot the RG. I decided that I would automate a weekend reboot of the RG. I could not figure out a way to ssh into the RG or use an API to tell it to reboot so I did the next best thing. I have a WTI PDU in my small rack and this PDU is connected to my network.  Using a web browser I can access the PDU and turn on or off outlets in the PDU.  I can also connect to the PDU with telnet and turn on and off outlets via a cli.  I chose to use expect and use the cli method to automate turning off the outlet the RG is connected to and then 30 seconds later turning this outlet back out. The script called reboot-rg.sh does this. I added a crontab to call this script every Sunday at 3:30am.  Now, I don't have problems with my AT&T RG any more. The script can be placed anywhere in the filesystem to run but I put it in /opt. The script will create logs in /var/log/reboot-rg.log
